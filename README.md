# NextJs-TailwindCSS-SASS Boilerplate

A well-structured ready Next.js boilerplate with TailwindCSS and SASS.

## About
**Next.js** is a minimalistic React framework that runs on the browser and the server. It offers developers an easy way to get started, and as it uses React.js for templating, it's also a straightforward way for developers with React experience to get productive quickly.

The advantage of this approach is to be able to create rich user experiences in a uniform way, without compromising SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) factors that are key to good ranking on Google and other search engines.


**TailwindCSS** is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs and a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override

**SASS** is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
